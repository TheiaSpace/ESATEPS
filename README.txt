ESAT EPS library version 2.1.0.

Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS) for ESAT.

This software runs in the ESAT EPS board.  Use it with Arduino 1.8.0
or newer together with the Arduino core for MSP430-based ESAT boards
(Theia Space's ESAT Boards (MSP430)) 2.2.0 or a newer 2.x.y version
and the ESAT utility library (ESATUtil) version 2.1.0 or a newer 2.x.y
version.  Use ESAT-EPS as the target board.

See the example EPS program (examples/EPS/EPS.ino).  This program
uses the modules of the EPS library.

The src/ directory contains the EPS library, which consists of the
following modules:


# ESAT_EPS

This is the main library that provides the general EPS functionality.


# ESAT_BatteryController

Battery voltage, current, temperature and state of charge readings.


# ESAT_BatteryModuleHousekeeping

Battery module housekeeping telemetry packet contents.


# ESAT_DirectEnergyTransferSystem

Readings on the direct energy transfer system.  The direct energy
transfer system can be used to dissipate excess power from the solar
panels.


# ESAT_EPSHousekeeping

General EPS housekeeping telemetry packet contents.


# ESAT_EPSLED

Control of the on-board heartbeat LED.


# ESAT_EPSMeasurements

On-board voltage and current measurements.


# ESAT_MaximumPowerPointTrackingDriver

Readings on the maximum power point tracking drivers.  The maximum
power point tracking system can be used to extract the maximum power
possible from the solar panels.


# ESAT_PowerLineSwitch

Control of the power line switches.


# ESAT_SolarPanelThermometer

Temperature measurements on the solar panels.

transfer system can be used to dissipate excess power from the solar
panels.


# ESAT_EPSMeasurements

On-board voltage and current measurements.


# ESAT_MaximumPowerPointTrackingDriver

Readings on the maximum power point tracking drivers.  The maximum
power point tracking system can be used to extract the maximum power
possible from the solar panels.
